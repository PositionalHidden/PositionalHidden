Petty said about the Wilburys touring: In the Rolling Stone Press book \"The New Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll\", the Traveling Wilburys are described as \"the ultimate supergroup\", with a line-up that represented four eras of rock music history and included \"three indisputable gods\" in Dylan, Harrison and Orbison. The editors also recognise the band as \"the antithesis of a supergroup\", however, due to the musicians' adoption of fraternal alter egos and the humour inherent in the project. AllMusic managing editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine has similarly written: \"It's impossible to picture a supergroup with\nDocument [2](Title: Traveling Wilburys) you and talk to you like we would anybody else.\" Dylan replied: \"Well, great. Believe it or not, I'm in awe of you guys, and it's the same for me.\" While most of the songs had a primary composer, all of the band members were creative equals. Petty later described Harrison as the Wilburys' \"leader and manager\", and credited him with being a bandleader and producer that had a natural instinct for bringing out the best in people and keeping a recording session productive. As the group's producers, Harrison and Lynne directed the sessions, with Harrison often auditioning each member\nDocument [3](Title: Traveling Wilburys) and mutual admiration among five established artists.

The project's work received much anticipation given the diverse nature of the singer-songwriters. The band members adopted tongue-in-cheek pseudonyms as half-brothers from a fictional Wilbury family of travelling musicians. \"Vol. 1\" was a critical and commercial success, helping to revitalise Dylan and Petty's respective careers.

During the Beatles' first tour of Scotland, in 1960, he had used the pseudonym \"Carl Harrison\", in reference to one of his favourite musicians, Carl Perkins. With the Traveling Wilburys, this concept was taken a step further, since the participants' real names do not appear anywhere on the album, liner notes, or the songwriting credits. With Harrison having the greatest claim to the band, he signed them up to Warner Bros.

Over the months following the end of recording in the summer, contractual issues had been successfully negotiated between Warner's and the record companies representing Dylan, Petty, Lynne and Orbison. As was the case in 1971 when EMI prepared Harrison's multi-artist live album from the Concert for Bangladesh for release, Columbia, Dylan's label, presented the main stumbling block. In the album credits, the \"Wilburys\" joke was extended further, with the band members listed under various pseudonyms and pretending to be half-brothers \u2013 sons of a fictional Charles Truscott Wilbury, Sr. During promotion for the album,\nDocument [13](Title: Traveling Wilburys) later said: \"We'd become this unit, we were all good pals \u2026 We always knew we were going to do another one, and now it's just the four of us.\" Harrison was the most active in promoting the Wilburys, carrying out interviews well into 1989. He said he was \"wait[ing] for all the other Wilburys to finish being solo artists\" so that they could renew the collaboration.

There, Harrison struck up a musical rapport with Petty based on their shared love of 1950s rock 'n' roll, and Lynne began collaborating with Petty on what became the latter's debut solo album, \"Full Moon Fever\", and writing songs with Orbison, Lynne's longtime musical hero, for Orbison's comeback album, \"Mystery Girl\". According to Petty, Harrison's dream for the Wilburys was to handpick the participants and create \"the perfect little band\", but the criteria for inclusion were governed most by \"who you could hang out with\". The five musicians also bonded\nDocument [15](Title: Traveling Wilburys Vol. 3) to 50's and 60's rock roots, drawing on blues, doo-wop, rockabilly and Buddy Holly.

In the years following \"Vol. 3\", there was speculation about further Wilbury releases. Since Harrison was viewed as the de facto leader of the group, his death in November 2001 ended the possibility of any future projects.

Vessel elements are hollow xylem cells without end walls that are aligned end-to-end so as to form long continuous tubes. The bryophytes lack true xylem tissue, but their sporophytes have a water-conducting tissue known as the hydrome that is composed of elongated cells of simpler construction.

Cronquist considered the vessels of \"Gnetum\" to be convergent with those of angiosperms. Whether the absence of vessels in basal angiosperms is a primitive condition is contested, the alternative hypothesis states that vessel elements originated in a precursor to the angiosperms and were subsequently lost. To photosynthesize, plants must absorb from the atmosphere. However, this comes at a price: while stomata are open to allow to enter, water can evaporate.

In 1727, English clergyman and botanist Stephen Hales showed that transpiration by a plant's leaves causes water to move through its xylem. By 1891, the Polish-German botanist Eduard Strasburger had shown that the transport of water in plants did not require the xylem cells to be alive.

The basic function of xylem is to transport water from roots to stems and leaves, but it also transports nutrients. The word \"xylem\" is derived from the Greek word (\"xylon\"), meaning \"wood\"; the best-known xylem tissue is wood, though it is found throughout the plant. The term was introduced by Carl N\u00e4geli in 1858. The most distinctive xylem cells are the long tracheary elements that transport water.

Though the bifacial cambium of modern trees produces both secondary phloem and xylem, the unifacial cambium of \"Lepidodendron\" trees produced only secondary xylem. As the trees aged, the wood produced by the unifacial cambium decreased towards the top of the plant such that terminal twigs resembled young \"Lepidodendron\" stems. The stems and branches of the trees contained little wood as compared to modern trees, with the majority of mature stems consisting of a massive cortical meristem. The near uniform growth of this cortical tissue\nDocument [10](Title: Vascular cambium) Other names for the vascular cambium are the main cambium, wood cambium, or bifacial cambium. In more detail, the vascular cambium is a plant tissue located between the xylem and the phloem in the stems and roots of certain vascular plants.  It is a cylinder of unspecialized meristem cells that divide to form secondary vascular tissues. It is the source of both secondary xylem growth inwards towards the pith, and secondary phloem growth outwards to the bark. Unlike the xylem and phloem, it does not transport water, minerals or food through the plant.\nDocument [11](Title: Ground tissue) the layers of secondary material seem like tubes, of which the outer one is always longer and older than the next. After completion of growth, the missing parts are supplemented, so that the wall is evenly thickened up to the tips of the fibers. Fibers usually originate from meristematic tissues. Cambium and procambium are their main centers of production. They are usually associated with the xylem and phloem of the vascular bundles. The fibers of the xylem are always lignified, while those of the phloem are cellulosic. Reliable evidence for the fibre cells' evolutionary origin from tracheids exists. During evolution\nDocument [12](Title: Dendrosicyos) The base consists largely of parenchyma. In it are embedded small xylem strands that are linked to each other (anastomosis). These xylem strands have a cambium, and a secondary phloem forms. There is not a consistently active cambium - it will always be sequentially formed on the periphery of a new cambium (cambium successively). \"Dendrosicyos\" is the first member of the Cucurbitaceae in which such meristem has been demonstrated. The leaves are about 25 cm long and wide, its leaf edge being slightly thorny. On the underside of the leaves are trichomes of from two to seven cells, the cells\nDocument [13](Title: Xylem) or more strands of primary xylem form in its stems and roots. The first xylem to develop is called 'protoxylem'. In appearance protoxylem is usually distinguished by narrower vessels formed of smaller cells. Some of these cells have walls which contain thickenings in the form of rings or helices. Functionally, protoxylem can extend: the cells are able to grow in size and develop while a stem or root is elongating. Later, 'metaxylem' develops in the strands of xylem. Metaxylem vessels and cells are usually larger; the cells have thickenings which are typically either in the form of ladderlike transverse bars\nDocument [14](Title: Phloem) is transport of sugars, phloem may also contain cells that have a mechanical support function. These generally fall into two categories: fibres and sclereids. Both cell types have a secondary cell wall and are therefore dead at maturity. The secondary cell wall increases their rigidity and tensile strength. Bast fibres are the long, narrow supportive cells that provide tension strength without limiting flexibility. They are also found in xylem, and are the main component of many textiles such as paper, linen, and cotton. Sclereids are irregularly shaped cells that add compression strength but may reduce flexibility to some extent. They\nDocument [15](Title: Vascular plant) and transported throughout the plant by the xylem. Organic compounds such as sucrose produced by photosynthesis in leaves are distributed by the phloem sieve tube elements. The xylem consists of vessels in flowering plants and tracheids in other vascular plants, which are dead hard-walled hollow cells arranged to form files of tubes that function in water transport. A tracheid cell wall usually contains the polymer lignin. The phloem however consists of living cells called sieve-tube members. Between the sieve-tube members are sieve plates, which have pores to allow molecules to pass through. Sieve-tube members lack such organs as nuclei or\nDocument [16](Title: Vascular tissue) produces woody growth. Because this growth ruptures the epidermis of the stem, woody plants also have a cork cambium that develops among the phloem. The cork cambium gives rise to thickened cork cells to protect the surface of the plant and reduce water loss. Both the production of wood and the production of cork are forms of secondary growth. In leaves, the vascular bundles are located among the spongy mesophyll. The xylem is oriented toward the adaxial surface of the leaf (usually the upper side), and phloem is oriented toward the abaxial surface of the leaf. This is why aphids\nDocument [17](Title: Xylem) function as the primary transport cells. The other type of tracheary element, besides the tracheid, is the vessel element. Vessel elements are joined by perforations into vessels. In vessels, water travels by \"bulk flow\", as in a pipe, rather than by diffusion through cell membranes. The presence of vessels in xylem has been considered to be one of the key innovations that led to the success of the angiosperms. However, the occurrence of vessel elements is not restricted to angiosperms, and they are absent in some archaic or \"basal\" lineages of the angiosperms: (e.g., Amborellaceae, Tetracentraceae, Trochodendraceae, and Winteraceae), and\nDocument [18](Title: Secondary growth) also occurs in many nonwoody plants, e.g. tomato, potato tuber, carrot taproot and sweet potato tuberous root. A few long-lived leaves also have secondary growth. Abnormal secondary growth does not follow the pattern of a single vascular cambium producing xylem to the inside and phloem to the outside as in ancestral lignophytes. Some dicots have anomalous secondary growth, e.g. in Bougainvillea a series of cambia arise outside the oldest phloem. Ancestral monocots lost their secondary growth and their stele has changed in a way it could not be recovered without major changes that are very unlikely to occur.

The elements have very similar properties: they are all shiny, silvery-white, somewhat reactive metals at standard temperature and pressure. Structurally, they have in common an outer s- electron shell which is full; that is, this orbital contains its full complement of two electrons, which these elements readily\nDocument [17](Title: Alkali metal) the trends and properties of ununennium and unhexpentium also mostly hold quite similarly for the corresponding alkaline earth metals unbinilium (Ubn) and unhexhexium (Uhh). The probable properties of further alkali metals beyond unhexpentium have not been explored yet as of 2015; in fact, it is suspected that they may not be able to exist. In periods 8 and above of the periodic table, relativistic and shell-structure effects become so strong that extrapolations from lighter congeners become completely inaccurate. In addition, the relativistic and shell-structure effects (which stabilise the s-orbitals and destabilise and expand the d-, f-, and g-orbitals of higher\nDocument [18](Title: Alkali metal) to many transition metal cyclopentadienyl derivatives. Similarly, the alkali metals react with cyclooctatetraene in tetrahydrofuran to give alkali metal cyclooctatetraenides; for example, dipotassium cyclooctatetraenide (KCH) is an important precursor to many metal cyclooctatetraenyl derivatives, such as uranocene. The large and very weakly polarising alkali metal cations can stabilise large, aromatic, polarisable radical anions, such as the dark-green sodium naphthalenide, Na[CH\u2022], a strong reducing agent.

Their great power as reducing agents makes them very useful in liberating other metals from their oxides or halides. The second ionisation energy of all of the alkali metals is very high as it is in a full shell that is also closer to the nucleus; thus, they almost always lose a single electron, forming cations. The alkalides are an exception: they are unstable compounds which contain alkali metals in a \u22121 oxidation state, which is very unusual as before the discovery of the alkalides, the alkali metals were not expected to be\n\nQuestion: where are alkali metals located on the periodic table\nAnswer:","output":"in the s-block"}

An electrical stimulation in the form of an action potential delivered in a rhythmic pattern triggers the release of calcium from the cell's internal calcium store, the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The rise in calcium causes the cell's myofilaments to slide past each other in a process called excitation contraction coupling. Diseases of heart muscle are of major importance.

This rate can be altered, however, by nerves that work to either increase heart rate (sympathetic nerves) or decrease it (parasympathetic nerves), as the body's oxygen demands change. Ultimately, muscle contraction revolves around a charged atom (ion), calcium (Ca), which is responsible for converting the electrical energy of the action potential into mechanical energy (contraction) of the muscle. This is achieved in a region of the muscle cell, called the transverse-tubule during a process known as calcium induced calcium release.

In cardiac and smooth muscle an electrical impulse (action potential) triggers calcium ions to enter the cell through an L-type calcium channel located in the cell membrane (smooth muscle) or T-tubule membrane (cardiac muscle). These calcium ions bind to and activate the RyR, producing a larger increase in intracellular calcium. In skeletal muscle, however, the L-type calcium channel is bound to the RyR.

Other neurons or tissues are much less responsive to the electric current, and therefore stay unaffected. Induced action potential is transmitted to neural endings innervating the muscle. Consequently, the muscle contracts independently of the brain activity.

This influx of sodium ions generates the EPP (depolarization), and triggers an action potential which travels along the sarcolemma and into the muscle fiber via the transverse tubules (T-tubules) by means of voltage-gated sodium channels. The conduction of action potentials along the transverse tubules stimulates the opening of voltage-gated Ca channels which are mechanically coupled to Ca release channels in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The Ca then diffuses out of the sarcoplasmic reticulum to the myofibrils so it can stimulate contraction.

At the same time, the penalties for underage drinking were increased to include a mandatory driver's license suspension.

Historically, a few municipalities had ordinances against\nDocument [3](Title: Alcohol law) in 1984, which tied federal highway funds to states' maintaining a minimum drinking age of 21. Despite a rekindled national debate in 2008 on the established drinking age (initiated by several university presidents), a Fairleigh Dickinson University PublicMind poll found in September 2008 that 76% of New Jerseyans supported leaving the legal drinking age at 21 years. No significant differences emerged when considering gender, political affiliation, or region. However, parents of younger children were more likely to support keeping the age at 21 (83%) than parents of college-age students (67%).

Between 1970 and 1975, 29 states lowered the MLDA from 21 to 18, 19, or 20. This was primarily due to the passing of the 26th Amendment, which lowered the required voting age from 21 to 18. During the 1960s, both Congress and the state legislatures came under increasing pressure to lower the minimum voting age from 21 to 18. This was in large part due to the Vietnam War, in which many young men who were ineligible to vote (or legally drink) were conscripted to fight in the war, thus lacking any means to influence the\nDocument [5](Title: National Minimum Drinking Age Act) alcoholic beverages. However, these changes were soon followed by studies showing an increase in motor vehicle fatalities attributable to the decreased MLDA. In response to these findings, many states raised the minimum legal drinking age to 19 (and sometimes to 20 or 21). In 1984, the National Minimum Legal Drinking Act, written by Senator Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ) and influenced by Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD), required all states to enforce a minimum legal drinking age of 21 or else risk losing 10% of all federal highway construction funds.

In 2004, the president of Vermont's Middlebury College, John McCardell, Jr. wrote in \"The New York Times\" that \"the 21-year-old drinking age is bad social policy and terrible law\" that has made the college drinking problem far worse. Groups that oppose the 21 minimum include Choose Responsibility, the Amethyst Initiative, and Students for Sensible Drug Policy. Mothers Against Drunk Driving supports the 21 law and has been the main opponent to lowering it back to 18.\nDocument [7](Title: Legal drinking age controversy in the United States) ruled the Act was constitutional and the States still had the right to set their own drinking ages. However, the Federal Government can give the state a 10% penalty on highway funds if the state chooses to have their drinking age lower than 21. Not even a year later, all 50 states of the United States officially made 21 the minimum legal drinking age.

For example, transposition from the key of C major to D major raises all pitches of the scale of C major equally by a whole tone. Since the interval relationships remain unchanged, transposition may be unnoticed by a listener, however other qualities may change noticeably because transposition changes the relationship of the overall pitch range compared to the range of the instruments or voices that perform the music. \nDocument [11](Title: Key (music)) the tonic note or chord returns. The key may be in the major or minor mode, though musicians assume major in a statement like, \"This piece is in C.\" Popular songs are usually in a key, and so is classical music during the common practice period, around 1650\u20131900. Longer pieces in the classical repertoire may have sections in contrasting keys. Methods that establish the key for a particular piece can be complicated to explain and vary over music history. However, the chords most often used in a piece in a particular key are those that contain the notes in the\nDocument [12](Title: Compositions 1960) keyboard cover without making, from the operation, any sound that is audible to you.

Key signatures of this kind can be found in the music of B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k, for example. The effect of a key signature continues throughout a piece or movement, unless explicitly cancelled by another key signature. For example, if a five-sharp key signature is placed at the beginning of a piece, every A in the piece in any octave will be played as A sharp, unless preceded by an accidental (for instance, the A in scale 2 illustrated \u2013\nDocument [14](Title: Key (music)) corresponding scale, and conventional progressions of these chords, particularly cadences, orient the listener around the tonic. The key signature is not always a reliable guide to the key of a written piece. It does not discriminate between a major key and its relative minor; the piece may modulate to a different key; if the modulation is brief, it may not involve a change of key signature, being indicated instead with accidentals. Occasionally, a piece in a mode such as Mixolydian or Dorian is written with a major or minor key signature appropriate to the tonic, and accidentals throughout the piece.\nDocument [15](Title: Key (music)) Key (music) In music theory, the key of a piece is the group of pitches, or scale, that forms the basis of a music composition in classical, Western art, and Western pop music. The group features a \"tonic note\" and its corresponding \"chords\", also called a \"tonic\" or \"tonic chord\", which provides a subjective sense of arrival and rest, and also has a unique relationship to the other pitches of the same group, their corresponding chords, and pitches and chords outside the group. Notes and chords other than the tonic in a piece create varying degrees of tension, resolved when\nDocument [16](Title: Key signature) only sharp in the G major scale is F sharp, so the key signature associated with the G major key is the one-sharp key signature. However, it is only a notational convenience; a piece with a one-sharp key signature is not necessarily in the key of G major, and likewise, a piece in G major may not always be written with a one-sharp key signature; this is particularly true in pre-Baroque music, when the concept of key had not yet evolved to its present state.

For example, in his Sonata No. 31 in A major, Op. 110, the first appearance of the Arioso section in the final movement is notated throughout in six flats; but it both begins and ends in A minor and has a significant modulation to C major, and both these keys theoretically\nDocument [18](Title: Dynamics (music)) change these as needed.

[T]he more I feel I know Schoenberg's music the more I believe he thought that way himself. ... And it isn't only the players; it's also the listeners. They will hear tonality in everything\" . Donald Jay Grout similarly doubted whether atonality is really possible, because \"any combination of\nDocument [20](Title: Parallel key) opposite sounds like a brightening). This change is quite distinct from a switch to the relative minor. Classical pieces in sonata allegro form in a minor key have their second theme in the relative major in the exposition, but the second theme comes back in the original minor key in the recapitulation. This is unique to the form, and allows the composer to state a given theme in both major and minor modes. Later it also became common to state the second theme in the tonic major in the recapitulation, with or without a later return to the minor.

If the SA node does not function, or the impulse generated in the SA node is blocked before it travels down the electrical conduction system, a group of cells further down the heart will become its pacemaker. The sinoatrial node was first discovered by a young medical student, Martin Flack, in the heart of a mole, whilst his mentor, Sir Arthur Keith, was on a bicycle ride with his wife. They made\nDocument [5](Title: Sinoatrial block) a lag between the time that the SA node fires and actual depolarization of the atria. This rhythm is not recognizable on an ECG strip because a strip does not denote when the SA node fires. It can be detected only during an electrophysiology study when a small wire is placed against the SA node from within the heart and the electrical impulses can be recorded as they leave the p-cells in the centre of the node [ see pacemaker potential ], followed by observing a delay in the onset of the p wave on the ECG.

The sinoatrial node (SA node) is a group of cells positioned on the wall of the right atrium, near the entrance of the superior vena cava. These cells are modified cardiomyocytes. They possess rudimentary contractile filaments, but contract relatively weakly compared to the cardiac contractile cells. The pacemaker cells are connected to neighboring contractile cells via gap junctions, which enable them to locally depolarize adjacent cells. Gap junctions allow the passage of positive cations from the depolarization of the pacemaker cell to adjacent contractile cells. This starts the depolarization\nDocument [7](Title: Cardiac physiology) ms to pass through the node. This pause is critical to heart function, as it allows the atrial cardiomyocytes to complete their contraction that pumps blood into the ventricles before the impulse is transmitted to the cells of the ventricle itself. With extreme stimulation by the SA node, the AV node can transmit impulses maximally at 220 per minute. This establishes the typical maximum heart rate in a healthy young individual. Damaged hearts or those stimulated by drugs can contract at higher rates, but at these rates, the heart can no longer effectively pump blood. Arising from the AV node,\nDocument [8](Title: Bradycardia) the SA node falls below the rate of the AV node. This dysrhythmia also may occur when the electrical impulses from the SA node fail to reach the AV node because of SA or AV block. This is a protective mechanism for the heart, to compensate for an SA node that is no longer handling the pacemaking activity, and is one of a series of backup sites that can take over pacemaker function when the SA node fails to do so. This would present with a longer PR interval.

Therefore, most of the important heart blocks are AV nodal blocks and infra-Hisian blocks. SA blocks are usually of lesser clinical significance, since in the event of SA block, the AV node contains a secondary pacemaker which would still maintain a heart rate of around 40 - 60 beats per minute, sufficient for consciousness and much of daily life in the majority of individuals. Following the\nDocument [10](Title: Electrical conduction system of the heart) Under normal conditions, electrical activity is spontaneously generated by the SA node, the cardiac pacemaker.

From there, the electrical stimulus is transmitted via internodal pathways to the atrioventricular (AV) node. After a brief delay at the AV node, the stimulus travels through the bundle of His to the left and right bundle branches and then to the Purkinje fibers and the endocardium at the apex of the heart, then finally to the ventricular myocardium.

Athanasius (367 AD), Cyril of Jerusalem (c. 350 AD) and Epiphanius of Salamis (c. 385 AD) listed as Canonical books the 22 books of the Hebrew Bible plus the \"Book of Baruch\" and the \"Epistle of Jeremy\". Epiphanius of Salamis (c. 385 AD) in his \"Panarion\" writes that along with the Hebrew bible books Jews had in their books the deuterocanonical Epistle of Jeremiah and Baruch, both combined with Jeremiah and Lamentations in only one book. The monk Rufinus of Aquileia (c. 400 AD)\nDocument [3](Title: Protestant Bible) not and therefore classify the seven Catholic deuterocanonical books as part of the Apocrypha. The practice of including only the Old and New Testament books within printed bibles was standardized among Protestants following the 1825 decision by the British and Foreign Bible Society. From the Reformation, Protestants have usually excluded the books which Roman Catholics and Orthodox Christians consider to be Deuterocanonical, viewing them as non-canonical. However, prior to an 1825 British and Foreign Bible Society decision, most Protestant Bibles did include these additional books within the same printed bibles. It was usually to be found in a separate section\nDocument [4](Title: Bible) Council of Trent 1545\u20131563. It includes 46 books for the Old Testament (45 if Jeremiah and Lamentations are counted as one) and 27 for the New. Most Protestants term these books as apocrypha. Modern Protestant traditions do not accept the deuterocanonical books as canonical, although Protestant Bibles included them in Apocrypha sections until the 1820s. However, Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches include these books as part of their Old Testament. The Roman Catholic Church recognizes: In addition to those, the Greek and Russian Orthodox Churches recognize the following: Russian and Georgian Orthodox Churches include: There is also 4 Maccabees\nDocument [5](Title: Vulgate) the 38 books of the Hebrew Bible (as counted in Christian tradition before Nehemiah became split from Ezra in the medieval period), but always also including books from the Septuagint tradition, which by this date had ceased to be used by Jews, but which was copied in Greek Bibles as their Old Testament. Modern critical editions of the Septuagint take their texts from the Old Testament found in the great 4th\/5th-century pandect bibles: Codex Vaticanus, Codex Sinaiticus, and Codex Alexandrinus; but no two of these present exactly the same canon of Old Testament books. Similarly, Vulgate Old Testaments continued to\nDocument [6](Title: Vulgate) lists of the 5th\/6th century, where 'two books of Ezra' were commonly cited. Again this split becomes standard in the Paris Bibles; and as these bibles commonly also included one or both of the two books of Esdras: Greek Esdras and Latin Esdras; these became retitled as 3 Ezra and 4 Ezra respectively. In translating the 38 books of the Hebrew Bible (Ezra-Nehemiah being counted as one book), Jerome was relatively free in rendering their text into Latin, but it is possible to determine that the oldest surviving complete manuscripts of the Masoretic Text, which date from nearly 600 years\nDocument [7](Title: Luther's canon) but which did not actually contain the disputed books, leading some historians to think that the workers at the printing presses took it upon themselves to omit them. However, Anglican and Lutheran Bibles usually still contained these books until the 20th century, while Calvinist Bibles did not. Several reasons are proposed for the omission of these books from the canon. One is the support for Catholic doctrines such as Purgatory and Prayer for the dead found in 2 Maccabees. Another is that the Westminster Confession of Faith of 1646, during the English Civil War, actually excluded them from the canon.\nDocument [8](Title: Revised Standard Version) The \"Common Bible\" of 1973 ordered the books in a way that pleased both Catholics and Protestants. It was divided into four sections: The non-deuterocanonicals gave the \"Common Bible\" a total of 81 books: it included 1 Esdras (also known as 3 Ezra), 2 Esdras (4 Ezra), and the Prayer of Manasseh, books that have appeared in the Vulgate's appendix since Jerome's time \"lest they perish entirely\", but are not considered canonical by Catholics and are thus not included in most modern Catholic Bibles. In 1977, the RSV Apocrypha was expanded to include 3 Maccabees, 4 Maccabees, and Psalm 151,\nDocument [9](Title: Books of the Bible) of Christian Bibles is called the Old Testament, which contains, at minimum, the above 24 books but divided into 39 books and ordered differently. The Catholic Church and Eastern Christian churches also hold that certain deuterocanonical books and passages are part of the Old Testament canon. The second part is the New Testament, containing 27 books; the four Canonical gospels, Acts of the Apostles, 21 Epistles or letters and the Book of Revelation.

The term distinguished these texts both from those that were termed protocanonical books, which were the books of the Hebrew canon; and from the apocryphal books, which were those books of Jewish origin that were known sometimes to have been read in church as scripture but which the\nDocument [11](Title: Biblical apocrypha) rationale for the exclusion: 'The books commonly called Apocrypha, not being of divine inspiration, are no part of the canon of the Scripture, and therefore are of no authority in the church of God, nor to be any otherwise approved, or made use of, than other human writings' (1.3). Thus, Bibles printed by English Protestants who separated from the Church of England began to exclude these books. All English translations of the Bible printed in the sixteenth century included a section or appendix for Apocryphal books. Matthew's Bible, published in 1537, contains all the Apocrypha of the later King James\nDocument [12](Title: Protestant Bible) intertestamental period in the chronology of the Christian scriptures between the Old and New Testaments. This period is known to Protestants as the \"400 Silent Years\" because it is believed to have been a span where God made no additional canonical revelations to his people. . Protestant Bibles comprise 39 books of the Old Testament (according to the Jewish Hebrew Bible canon, known especially to non-Protestants as the protocanonical books) and the 27 books of the New Testament for a total of 66 books. These books with their commonly accepted names among the Protestant churches are given below.

In the Council of Florence (1442 AD), a list was promulgated of the books of the Bible, including the books of Judith, Esther, Wisdom, Ecclesiasticus, Baruch and two books of the Maccabees as Canonical books. One of the tenets of the Protestant Reformation (beginning c. 1517) was that translations of scriptures should be based on the original texts (i.e. Biblical Hebrew and Biblical Aramaic for the Old Testament and Biblical Greek for\nDocument [14](Title: Biblical apocrypha) and 4 Esdras follow 2 Esdras (Nehemiah), and Prayer of Solomon follows Ecclesiasticus. Martin Luther translated the Bible into German during the early part of the 16th century, first releasing a complete Bible in 1534. His Bible was the first major edition to have a separate section called \"Apocrypha\". Books and portions of books not found in the Masoretic Text of Judaism were moved out of the body of the Old Testament to this section. Luther placed these books between the Old and New Testaments. For this reason, these works are sometimes known as \"inter-testamental books\". The books 1 and\nDocument [15](Title: The Books of the Bible) was also presented as a single book in \"The Original New Testament\" (1985).) In 2006 the International Bible Society published Luke-Acts as a separate volume in the format of \"The Books of the Bible\" under the title \"Kingdom Come, Kingdom Go.\" The accustomed order of the books of the Bible only became fixed in the mid\u201315th century with the advent of printing. Before that, the books were presented or listed in a variety of orders. In the case of the First Testament or Old Testament, Roger Beckwith explains that \"this stability of order is a relatively modern phenomenon, and owes\nDocument [16](Title: Apocrypha) Jubilees, which is part of the Ethiopian canon, as well as the Assumption of Moses and the Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs, which are included in no biblical canon. The canonical validity of the intertestamental books was challenged in the 16th century by Protestants. The Protestant removal of the deuterocanonical books of the Bible did not happen immediately as part of the Reformation, but rather happened in waves over time. The apocryphal books were in fact translated as part of the King James Version of the Bible. Eventually they were effectively removed by Protestants during the 1800s, with some Protestants\nDocument [17](Title: Bible translations into English) Old Testament was completed by the time the New Testament was published, but due to extenuating circumstances and financial issues was not published until nearly three decades later, in two editions, the first released in 1609, and the rest of the OT in 1610. In this version, the seven deuterocanonical books are mingled with the other books, rather than kept separate in an appendix.

Deciding which books should be included in the Biblical canon took about another two centuries; some differences remain between churches to the present day. The Septuagint also included some books that are not in the Hebrew Bible, which the church accepted due to their use at the time of Christ and because Christ quoted directly from and\/or referenced these books in the Gospels of the New Testament. The Bible was translated into various languages in late antiquity; the most important of these translations are those in the Syriac dialect of Aramaic (including the\nDocument [19](Title: Deuterocanonical books) Bible to this day. Deuterocanonical books The deuterocanonical books (from the Greek meaning \"belonging to the second canon\") are books and passages considered by the Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church to be canonical books of the Old Testament but which are considered non-canonical by Protestant denominations. They are seven books from the Septuagint, the standard translation of the Hebrew Bible in the Hellenistic period, written during the reign of Ptolemy II (283\u2013246 BCE) and referenced extensively in the New Testament, particularly in the Pauline Epistles.

Mendeleev's table was his first published version; that of Meyer was an expanded version of his (Meyer's) table of 1864. They both constructed their tables by listing the elements in rows or columns in order of atomic weight and starting a new row or column when the characteristics of the elements began to repeat. The recognition and acceptance afforded to Mendeleev's table came from two decisions he made. The first was to leave gaps in the table when it seemed that the corresponding element had\nDocument [2](Title: Periodic table) not yet been discovered. Mendeleev was not the first chemist to do so, but he was the first to be recognized as using the trends in his periodic table to predict the properties of those missing elements, such as gallium and germanium. The second decision was to occasionally ignore the order suggested by the atomic weights and switch adjacent elements, such as tellurium and iodine, to better classify them into chemical families. Mendeleev published in 1869, using atomic weight to organize the elements, information determinable to fair precision in his time. Atomic weight worked well enough to allow Mendeleev to\nDocument [3](Title: History of the periodic table) in an obscure Russian journal and then republished in a German journal, \"Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Chemie\". In it, Mendeleev stated that: Scientific benefits of Mendeleev's table Unknown to Mendeleev, a German chemist, Lothar Meyer, was also working on a periodic table. Although his work was published in 1864, and was done independently of Mendeleev, few historians regard him as an equal co-creator of the periodic table. Meyer's table only included twenty-eight elements, which were not classified by atomic weight, but by valence, and he never reached the idea of predicting new elements and correcting atomic weights. A few months after Mendeleev\nDocument [4](Title: History of the periodic table) published his periodic table of the known elements, predicted new elements to help complete his table and corrected the atomic weights of some of the elements, Meyer published a virtually identical periodic table. Meyer and Mendeleev are considered by some historians of science to be the co-creators of the periodic table, but Mendeleev's accurate prediction of the qualities of undiscovered elements enables him to have the larger share of the credit. In 1864, the English chemist William Odling also drew up a table that was remarkably similar to the table produced by Mendeleev. Odling overcame the tellurium-iodine problem and even\nDocument [5](Title: Dmitri Mendeleev) Chemists until 1887. Another person to propose a periodic table was Lothar Meyer, who published a paper in 1864 describing 28 elements classified by their valence, but with no prediction of new elements. After becoming a teacher in 1867, Mendeleev wrote the definitive textbook of his time: \"Principles of Chemistry\" (two volumes, 1868\u20131870). It was written as he was preparing a textbook for his course. This is when he made his most important discovery. As he attempted to classify the elements according to their chemical properties, he noticed patterns that led him to postulate his periodic table; he claimed to\nDocument [6](Title: History of chemistry) properties within groups of elements. Mendeleev's law allowed him to build up a systematic periodic table of all the 66 elements then known based on atomic mass, which he published in \"Principles of Chemistry\" in 1869. His first Periodic Table was compiled on the basis of arranging the elements in ascending order of atomic weight and grouping them by similarity of properties. Mendeleev had such faith in the validity of the periodic law that he proposed changes to the generally accepted values for the atomic weight of a few elements and, in his version of the periodic table of 1871,\nDocument [7](Title: Alexandre-E\u0301mile Be\u0301guyer de Chancourtois) of many chemistry experts. It was not until 1869 that Dmitri Mendeleyev's periodic table attracted attention and gained widespread scientific acceptance. He always managed to put the names of his four children into his work by writing their names on a corner of his work. Landon, Lynelle, Steve and Berdine were on all his work.

De Chancourtois only published his paper,\nDocument [8](Title: Periodic table) form (as shown at various other points in this article), is attributable to Horace Groves Deming. In 1923, Deming, an American chemist, published short (Mendeleev style) and medium (18-column) form periodic tables. Merck and Company prepared a handout form of Deming's 18-column medium table, in 1928, which was widely circulated in American schools. By the 1930s Deming's table was appearing in handbooks and encyclopaedias of chemistry. It was also distributed for many years by the Sargent-Welch Scientific Company. With the development of modern quantum mechanical theories of electron configurations within atoms, it became apparent that each period (row) in the\nDocument [9](Title: History of the periodic table) were \"earth\", \"water\", \"air\" and \"fire\". Similar ideas about these four elements also existed in other ancient traditions, such as Indian philosophy. The history of the periodic table is also a history of the discovery of the chemical elements. The first person in history to discover a new element was Hennig Brand, a bankrupt German merchant. Brand tried to discover the Philosopher's Stone \u2014 a mythical object that was supposed to turn inexpensive base metals into gold. In 1669 (or later), his experiments with distilled human urine resulted in the production of a glowing white substance, which he called \"cold\nDocument [10](Title: History of the periodic table) The history of the periodic table reflects over a century of growth in the understanding of chemical properties. The most important event in its history occurred in 1869, when the table was published by Dmitri Mendeleev, who built upon earlier discoveries by scientists such as Antoine-Laurent de Lavoisier and John Newlands, but who is nevertheless generally given sole credit for its development.\nDocument [11](Title: History of chemistry) many of his predictions within his lifetime brought fame to Mendeleev as the founder of the periodic law. This organization surpassed earlier attempts at classification by Alexandre-\u00c9mile B\u00e9guyer de Chancourtois, who published the telluric helix, an early, three-dimensional version of the periodic table of the elements in 1862, John Newlands, who proposed the law of octaves (a precursor to the periodic law) in 1864, and Lothar Meyer, who developed an early version of the periodic table with 28 elements organized by valence in 1864.

However, Lavoisier's descriptions of his elements lack completeness, as he only classified them as metals and non-metals. In 1815, the English physician and chemist William Prout noticed that atomic weights seemed to be multiples of that of hydrogen. In 1817, Johann Wolfgang D\u00f6bereiner, a chemist, began to formulate one of the earliest attempts to classify the elements.

On 6 March 1869, he made a formal presentation to the Russian Chemical Society, titled \"The Dependence between the Properties of the Atomic Weights of the Elements\", which described elements according to both atomic weight and valence. This presentation stated that Mendeleev published his periodic table of all known elements and predicted several new elements\nDocument [14](Title: History of the periodic table) managed to get thallium, lead, mercury and platinum into the right groups, which is something that Mendeleev failed to do at his first attempt. Odling failed to achieve recognition, however, since it is suspected that he, as Secretary of the Chemical Society of London, was instrumental in discrediting Newlands' earlier work on the periodic table. By 1912 almost 50 different radioactive elements had been found, too many for the periodic table. Frederick Soddy in 1913 found that although they emitted different radiation, many elements were alike in their chemical characteristics so shared the same place on the table. They became\nDocument [15](Title: Henry D. Hubbard) Henry D. Hubbard Henry D. Hubbard was a member of the U.S. Bureau of Standards in the 1920s.

This version of the periodic table placed the main groups in columns with some later groups taking up two rows per period and the Group VIIIB transition metals displayed out to the right of the noble gases.

A periodic table in which each row corresponds to one value of \"n + \u2113\" was suggested by Charles Janet in 1927. In 1936, the German physicist Erwin Madelung proposed his empirical rules for the order of filling atomic subshells, based on knowledge of atomic ground states determined by the analysis of atomic spectra, and most English-language sources therefore refer to the Madelung rule. Madelung may have been aware of this pattern as early as 1926. In 1962 the Russian agricultural chemist V.M. Klechkowski proposed the first\nDocument [17](Title: Charles Janet) confused idea of his thinking. Janet started from the fact that the series of chemical elements is a continuous sequence, which he represented as a helix traced on the surfaces of four nested cylinders. By various geometrical transformations he derived several striking designs, one of which is his \"left-step Periodic Table\", in which hydrogen and helium are placed above lithium and beryllium. It was only later that he realized that his arrangement agreed perfectly with quantum theory and the electronic structure of the atom. He placed the actinides under the lanthanides twenty years before Glenn Seaborg, and he continued the\nDocument [18](Title: Periodic table) table corresponded to the filling of a quantum shell of electrons. Larger atoms have more electron sub-shells, so later tables have required progressively longer periods. In 1945, Glenn Seaborg, an American scientist, made the suggestion that the actinide elements, like the lanthanides, were filling an f sub-level. Before this time the actinides were thought to be forming a fourth d-block row. Seaborg's colleagues advised him not to publish such a radical suggestion as it would most likely ruin his career.

Continuing Johann Wolfgang D\u00f6bereiner's work with triads and Jean-Baptiste Dumas' families of similar elements, he published in 1865 his 'Law of Octaves', which stated that 'any given element will exhibit analogous behaviour to the eighth element following it in the table.'

While Kaufmann was still evaluating his experiments, Einstein published his theory of special relativity. Eventually, Kaufmann published his results in December 1905 and argued that they are in agreement with Abraham's theory and require rejection of the \"basic assumption of Lorentz and Einstein\" (the relativity principle).

In addition, only Einstein's theory gave the correct value for the deflection of light near the sun. The need to put together relativity and quantum mechanics was one of the major motivations in the development of quantum field\nDocument [10](Title: Theory of relativity) The theory of relativity usually encompasses two interrelated theories by Albert Einstein: special relativity and general relativity.  Special relativity applies to elementary particles and their interactions, describing all their physical phenomena except gravity. General relativity explains the law of gravitation and its relation to other forces of nature. It applies to the cosmological and astrophysical realm, including astronomy.\nDocument [11](Title: Criticism of the theory of relativity) of the theoretical physicists and mathematicians by 1911, it was not before publication of the experimental results of the eclipse expeditions (1919) by a group around Arthur Stanley Eddington that relativity was noticed by the public. Following Eddington's publication of the eclipse results, Einstein was glowingly praised in the mass media, and was compared to Nikolaus Copernicus, Johannes Kepler and Isaac Newton, which caused a popular \"relativity hype\" (\"Relativit\u00e4tsrummel\", as it was called by Sommerfeld, Einstein, and others). This triggered a counter-reaction of some scientists and scientific laymen who could not accept the concepts of modern physics, including relativity theory\nDocument [12](Title: Albert Einstein) by introducing changes to the laws of mechanics. Observationally, the effects of these changes are most apparent at high speeds (where objects are moving at speeds close to the speed of light). The theory developed in this paper later became known as Einstein's special theory of relativity.

Around the end of the 19th century, the view was widespread that all forces in nature are of electromagnetic origin (the \"electromagnetic worldview\"), especially in the works of Joseph Larmor (1897) and Wilhelm Wien (1900). This was apparently confirmed by the experiments of Walter Kaufmann (1901\u20131903), who measured an increase of the mass of a body with velocity which was consistent with the hypothesis that the mass was generated by its electromagnetic field. Max Abraham (1902) subsequently sketched a\nDocument [14](Title: Leibniz Institute for Astrophysics Potsdam) few weeks after the theory's publication by Einstein, Schwarzschild found the first solution of the Einstein equations, which is now named after him as the \"Schwarzschild solution\" and which is of fundamental importance for the theory of black holes. There exist further close links between the AOP and Einstein's Relativity Theory. In 1881 Albert A. Michelson first performed his interferometer experiments in the cellar of the main building of the AOP, that were to disprove the movement of the Earth through a hypothetical aether. His negative results were fundamentally reconciled only through Einstein's Special Relativity theory of 1905.

He tried to prove the applicability of the Lorentz transformation for all orders, although he didn't succeed completely. Like Wien and Abraham, he argued that there exists only electromagnetic mass, not mechanical mass, and derived the correct expression for longitudinal and transverse mass, which were in agreement with Kaufmann's experiments (even though those experiments were not precise enough to distinguish between the theories of Lorentz and Abraham). And using the electromagnetic momentum, he could explain the negative result of the Trouton\u2013Noble experiment, in which a charged parallel-plate capacitor moving through the aether should orient itself perpendicular\nDocument [16](Title: Jun Ishiwara) it with the theory of relativity. The scientist also made attempts to build a five-dimensional theory for unification of the gravitational and electromagnetic fields. In the first paper devoted to the problems of quantum physics (1911), Ishiwara derived Planck's law and tried to substantiate the wave properties of radiation on the basis of the assumption that it consists of light quanta. Thus, he anticipated certain ideas of Louis de Broglie and Satyendra Nath Bose. In the same year 1911, the Japanese scientist supported the hypothesis of light quanta as a possible explanation of the nature of X-rays and gamma rays.\nDocument [17](Title: Nobel Prize controversies) for Special Relativity were for both Hendrik Lorentz and Einstein. Henri Poincar\u00e9 was also nominated at least once for his work, including on Lorentz's relativity theory. However, Kaufmann's then-experimental results (incorrectly) cast doubt on Special Relativity. These doubts were not resolved until 1915. By this time, Einstein had progressed to his general theory of relativity, including his theory of gravitation. Empirical support\u2014in this case the predicted spectral shift of sunlight\u2014was in question for many decades. The only piece of original evidence was the consistency with the known perihelion precession of the planet Mercury.

In his paper on mass\u2013energy equivalence, Einstein produced \"E\" = \"mc\" as a consequence of his special relativity equations. Einstein's 1905 work on relativity remained controversial for many years, but was accepted by leading physicists, starting with Max Planck. Einstein originally framed special relativity in terms of kinematics (the study of moving bodies). In 1908, Hermann Minkowski reinterpreted special relativity in geometric terms as a theory of spacetime. Einstein adopted Minkowski's formalism in his 1915 general theory of relativity.

John Stachel (1995) argued that there is a debate over the respective contributions of Lorentz, Poincar\u00e9 and Einstein to relativity.

This is incompatible with classical mechanics and special relativity because in those theories inertially moving objects cannot accelerate with respect to each other, but objects in free fall do so. To resolve this difficulty Einstein first proposed that spacetime is curved. In 1915, he devised the Einstein field equations which relate the curvature of spacetime with the mass, energy, and any momentum within it.

The 3GPP has stated several general requirements stated for operation of the IMS. These include an efficient use of the radio interface by minimizing the exchange of signaling messages between the mobile terminal and the network, a minimum session setup time by performing tasks prior to session establishment instead of during session establishment, a minimum support required in the terminal, the support for roaming and non-roaming scenarios with terminal mobility management (supported by the access network, not SIP), and support for IPv6 addressing.

Subsequent UPDATE requests are sent to inform about the reservation progress, and they are answered by 2XX response codes. In a typical offer\/answer exchange, one UPDATE will be sent by the calling party when its reservation is completed, then the called party will respond and eventually finish allocating the resources.

According to the 3GPP, IMS is not intended to standardize applications, but rather to aid the access of multimedia and voice applications from wireless and wireline terminals, i.e., to create a form of fixed-mobile convergence (FMC).

The only requirement is that they can use IP and run SIP user agents.

When the S-CSCF receives a request for that GRUU, it will be able to route the request to the registered SIP instance. The efficient use of network resources, which may include a radio interface or other low-bandwidth access, is essential in the IMS in order to provide the user with an acceptable experience in terms of latency.
